- 145,000,000,000,000 Locked in team wallet, DxSale Team Wallet Address â”‚ DxSale Vesting Contract We initially locked this address until June 1st, 2022. Then the team wallet will be re-locked until February 24th, 2024.

- The BitCa\$h we locked inside the DxSale address will be unlocked at a slow pace of 1% every 10 days for 1,000 days as demands and market conditions dictate

- **Tx Fee:** Any transaction that involves BitCa\$h to cash or cash to BitCa\$h that is converted to Bitcoin Cash will incur nominal fee of 2% on all transfer transaction but not on any purchases from merchants. These transaction fees will be sent to an address where it will be converted to Bitcoin Ca\$h and BITCOIN for equal redistribution to all hold of BitCa\$h this will be permanently locked in the terms of the smart contract

- Only the 120 trillion tokens that we originally sent can ever be released from the address

- **Reflection Protocol:** **5%** of every transaction gets redistributed proportionately depending on how much BitC\$H they possess in their wallet through static reflection on each transaction

- **Auto-LockedLiquidity Protocol:** **3%** of every transaction into our locked liquidity pool. As a result, the base price of a single USD will be attained more quickly creating a more stable floating currency rate that also becomes dynamic as time goes on
